### Development Steps

#### 1. **Define the Requirements**

- Determine all input fields, calculations, and features (e.g., real-time data pulling).
- List key formulas for calculating the budgets.

#### 2. **Choose Your Tech Stack**

- **Frontend:** React.js, Vue.js, or another lightweight JavaScript framework.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Python (Django or Flask), or PHP (Laravel).
- **Database:** Use something like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or Firebase to save user input/history.
- **Hosting:** Deploy via a platform like Vercel, AWS, or Heroku.

#### 3. **Design the UI/UX**

- Use tools like Figma to design a clean interface.
- Ensure it's mobile-friendly for on-the-go budget checks.

#### 4. **Develop the App**

- **Frontend:** Create input fields for all required values and display the calculated outputs dynamically.
- **Backend:** Implement the logic for budget calculations.
- **Database:** Store historical data for future reference.
- Implement user authentication (if needed).

#### 5. **Optional API Integration**

- Use Meta's Marketing API to pull real-time campaign spend data and reduce manual input.
- Include toggles for manual vs. automated inputs.

#### 6. **Test Thoroughly**

- Check edge cases like zero days remaining, large budget changes, and incorrect inputs.
- Ensure calculations are accurate and consistent.

#### 7. **Launch and Iterate**

- Host the app and gather feedback.
- Add new features like multi-user accounts, charts, or recommendations.
