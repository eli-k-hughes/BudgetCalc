# Development Log

## 2025-02-12 22:23:53 AEDT - Initial Development Plan

### Chosen Structure
For the initial development, we'll start with a simple but scalable structure:

1. **Frontend Only Approach (Phase 1)**
   - Single-page React application
   - No backend initially
   - Local storage for saving calculations
   - Pure client-side calculations
   - Easy deployment to GitHub Pages

Rationale:
- Starting with frontend-only allows rapid development and testing
- React provides excellent component reusability and state management
- GitHub Pages deployment is free and simple
- No backend means no server costs or complex deployment initially
- Can later add backend services if needed

### Next Steps:
1. Set up basic React project using Vite (modern, fast build tool)
2. Create basic calculation logic in TypeScript
3. Implement minimal UI with form inputs
4. Add local storage functionality
5. Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Why This Approach?
- **Simple to Start**: Focus on core functionality first
- **Easy Testing**: Local development with immediate feedback
- **Quick Deployment**: GitHub Pages deployment is straightforward
- **Future-Proof**: Can be extended with backend services later
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript provides better development experience

### Technical Decisions:
- Vite + React + TypeScript for development
- TailwindCSS for styling (utility-first CSS framework)
- Vitest for testing
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment

Would you like me to proceed with setting up the initial project structure?
